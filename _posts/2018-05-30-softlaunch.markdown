Hello and welcome! If you're reading this, you probably know me on some 
semi-personal level. I'm happy to have you here as I get ready for a big step
in my life! After nearly ten years in New York City, this July I'll be emigrating
to Tokyo. I am terrified and excited at the same time as it's something 
I've wanted to do since I was ten years old (side note: around this age I 
remember unsuccessfully running around in _Phantasy Star Online_ lobbies begging 
strangers for plane tickets to Japan) but I'm terrified because I'm leaving behind literally everyone I care about. Coming to terms with everything that means
is proving to be difficult. With no fixed contract length, I have no idea just 
how long I'll be there so I'll be writing about my experiences while I'm abroad.


I'm comfortable saying entries here will be sporadic and the scope of my ramblings 
will vary greatly. I'm sure I'll share frustrations while improving my Japanese, 
give thoughts and impressions on video games I play, embarass myself as I share
hilarious cultural misunderstandings, vent while I go over coding problems on 
paper, or even just provide an update to share the occasional neat stuff.


Occasionally I'll write posts in Japanese as a means to get better at 
the language. For those that _can't_ read Japanese: I'm sorry -- I have to 
practice to improve. For those that _can_ read Japanese: I'm sorry -- I have to 
practice to improve. Those posts will fall under their own categories for those 
of who end up deciding to filter them. The overall goal is fluency and I am 
approximately at the [N4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test)
level (that means not very good).

And I suppose the last thing I should point out is the 
[stream](https://nowitsawkward.com/stream) page which is simply an embed of my
twitch account. I like playing games. Sometimes I play games that are fun to 
watch. If you feel like keeping tabs on me beyond just reading the occasional
post, the live streams and archives will keep you appraised. If that's not your
thing, feel free to stick around the rest of this place. 

You're most certainly welcome here.
