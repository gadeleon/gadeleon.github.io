Palm trees! Palm trees!? 

I was fortunate to spend a four-day weekend in Fukuoka (福岡) in the middle of 
February. I'll detail why in a separate post but I wanted to share my experience 
in the city itself.

So where's Fukuoka? It's in Kyuushuu (九州) which is the Western island of Japan.

Kyuushuu has a of lot really interesting history compared to the rest of Japan.
It's proximity to Korea, China, Russia, and the fact that Europe sailed due East
to Japan meant if you traded with the Land of the Rising Sun, you were probably 
doing business in Kyuushuu. This exposure to multiple cultures and healthy foreign
trade made Kyuushuu reasonably independent from the whims of the Imperial 
Governments throughout Japan's history (which is somewhat amusing considering a 
major Imperial player during the Boshin War came from Satsuma (薩摩) in Southern
Kyuushuu). 

I didn't have much opportunity to learn about the history of Fukoka City itself
but I did learn a few interesting things. Fukuoka was originally two different
cities: Fukoka and Hakata (博多). These two cities were separated by the Nakasu
River (中洲川) with Fukuoka to the West and Hakata to the East. I walked along 
this river quite a bit over the weekend and the photos I have don't quite do
it justice:

At night, along the river there's about a dozen small "tents" for Ramen, 
Yakitori, and other delicious-but-unhealthy food. Unfortunately, they all allowed
smoking so I opted to pass on what could have been a good time. Sorry that this
photo is blurry, but I kept trying to walk while taking this photo so I wouldn't
get in the way of the locals.

So Fukuoka was the residential area for the Samurai class; Hakata, 
the mercantile (is that the right word?) class. In Japan, these two groups 
historically didn't get along but Fukuoka's Samurai, largely due to the
geographical separation, were able to not-be-jerks to the merchants of Hakata 
and instead would just buy their wares, goods, and services.

The "Fukuoka dish" is ramen. Specifically, "Hakata Style" which is very hearty 
(re: fatty & oily) and a bit spicy (by Japanese standards, ie: not very). The 
only ramen I sampled happened to be a chain restaurant (whoops!) but it was 
still _very_ good!

Arguably my favorite part of the trip was exploring the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.
I didn't know it existed until I looked at my phone's map on Saturday morning. 
When I read "Fukuoka Castle Ruins," I immediately knew where I'd spend half my
day.

After a 40 minute walk, I came across the ruins which are now preserved as a
national park and recreation area. Soccer fields and tennis courts
surround the deceptively large ruins. There are stone walls roughly 
12 feet high and the Cherry Blossom trees were barely starting to bud.

It turns out, in Feudal Japan, castles were basically small villages and hence, 
they needed to be more than just fortresses. At the top I witnessed my favorite 
views overlooking the nearby Ohori Park (大濠公園):

I had a fantastic time walking around both Fukuoka and Hakata. I surprised maybe
four or five people with my Japanese. One local was so surprised he took a photo
with me. Most would say with "Wow, you're Japanese is great!" but I brought them 
back down to Earth by replying "not really, I'm at the level of a two-year old." 
It's a bit of a canned phrase I've developed here but I still appreciated the 
reply from the man who joked "No, you're more like a three-year old!" 

That's all from me for now. You'll be hearing more about my primary adventure
in Fukuoka another time! Please enjoy one of the last photos I took: a view of 
the ocean from the tip of Northwestern Hakata.

It's the closest I've ever been to the continent of Asia!
