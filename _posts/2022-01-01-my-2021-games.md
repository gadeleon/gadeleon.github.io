BRIEF THOUGHTS ON THE YEAR.

* Very lucky in that I got both a Series X, PS5, and OLED
* 2021 was very rough for me. 
* Got my first VG credit in over a decade!
* Wanted to look back on memories from the year.
* A top 10 + honorable mentions this year.


# Honorable Mention
I actually did not "collect" many games this year. What I mean is I purchased very few games and those that I did, I played through immediately afterwards! That said, while I wanted to focus on Top 10,  a few games I also felt like mentioning.

## Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity

### Winner of: Most Disappointing

I don't play many 無双 (muso) games and was hopeful that _Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity_ would do enough to keep me engaged with its gameplay while exploring a timeline I was deeply interested in. The story is a prequel to _Breath of the Wild_ taking place during the war against the Calamity Ganon which ultimately that ultimately ends in defeat. I was so ready to see _how_ we failed. 

I put roughly 40 hours into the game (maybe 3 were spent on loading screens alone!) and felt that, while I definitely got my money's worth in terms of playtime, it was not the satisfying prequel I was hoping it would be. I'm being very modest, actually. I actually _really_ disliked what they did with the story and it soured me on the _Hyrule Warriors_ franchise. That said, maybe I'll take a look at the next _Fire Emblems_ 無双 game.
