# _Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers_ Presents: My 2021 In Games
![FFVII_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5658865/71638913-f7696580-2caf-11ea-986e-968cf17807dd.jpg)
\-\-SLUG-Goes-HERE\-\-

Let me start off by saying, I made a rule for myself: _Final Fantasy XIV_ would win every year if I didn't adjust my criteria. So instead, I'm havirg the land of Eorzea sponsor this year's gaming roundup. Granted, I'm writing this in November and _Endwalker_ comes out the beginning of December. So I may just have to shuffle things around. 

Where do I start? 2021 was an incredibly difficult year me. There were some materialistic highs (getting a PS5, Xbox Series X, and OLED switch all in the same year) but also some deep personal lows (which are out of scope for here). Looking back, I am still processing everything and I wonder how I will view 2021 as time moves on.

Much like in [2019](https://www.nowitsawkward.com/social/2020/01/01/my-2019-games.html), I've opted to chronicle my 2021 through the video games I've played. Looking at my catalog, I played 19 games, beating most of the ones that can be beaten. I'll share my top 10 + a few honorable mentions because, well, I felt they were noteworthy and they earned the honors I've deigned upon them! 



# Honorable Mention
I actually did not "collect" many games this year. What I mean is I purchased very few games and those that I did, I played through immediately afterwards! These games are unranked but can essentially all be considered tied for 11.


## Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (2020)
### Most Disappointing, Longest Load Times
![HYRULE]()

I don't play many 無双 (muso) games and was hopeful that _Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity_ would do enough to keep me engaged with its gameplay while exploring a timeline I was deeply interested in. The game is a prequel to  _Breath of the Wild_ taking place during the war against the Calamity Ganon -- the result of which is the backdrop for _BotW_. I was so ready to see _how_ we failed and in late January of 2021, I finished completing the last few side missions and unlocked all the characters. 

I put roughly 40 hours into the game and felt that, while I definitely got my money's worth in terms of playtime, it was not the satisfying prequel I was hoping it would be. While I appreciated the varying gameplay mechanics of the different characters, load times and plot (no spoilers here) soured my experience. Ultimately, it wasn't what I wanted outed of _Hyrule Warriors_. I felt the gameplay was fine so maybe I'll take a look at the next _Fire Emblems_ 無双 game -- at least from a safe distance. 

## Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition (2020)
### Most Irreverant, Most Confusing
My first Playstation 5 experience (I hadn't played _Astro's Playroom_ yet) came in the form of Capcom's _Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition_. This was my first DMC experience and while gameplay was fun, I found myself constantly trying to keep up with a plot that made very little sense to me despite watching a "Story So Far" video included in the main menu. 

The game looks amazing and is technically one of the best games I've seen. On the PS5, the game has fantastic load times and high framerate (in performance mode) which really emphasizes how powerful the PS5 is and helps match the fast pace of the game. 

The absurd presentation and self-irreverance gives _Devil May Cry 5_  a fun, refreshing charm that I don't often see in my normal wheelhouse of games. The over-the-top nature actually helped get me into the game early on as each sequence but almost to the game's detriment, I kept wanting to understand more and wasn't able to grasp many answers. I felt if I started with the series back when it was younger, maybe I'd have gotten more out of the game. My experience with it didn't get it into the top 10, however, I definitely feel it was noteworthy.

I will never-not-love reading emo poetry as a special attack. 

# 10. FIFA 22 (2021)
## Best Sports RPG, Easiest Way to Lose Three Hours
![GAME10]()
First, let's address this upfront: _FIFA Ultimate Team_ is the one of the worst things to happen in Video Game History. Even if it's not gambling, it's close enough to the spirit of gambling, that I round it up to gambling. I've never opened a single pack and have zero intention to touch that mode every. Still with me? 

I haven't played a soccer game since _FIFA 16_ but this year (probably because of the Euros in the summer) I got the itch. In my opinion, the soon-to-be-renamed _FIFA_ series' career mode may be one of the best RPG experiences ever -- assuming you like the game of Association Football (soccer). You can either be a player, limiting yourself to a single player career joining a team and playing along AI teammates trying to win trophies. Or, you can be a manager (playing the entire team in the process) and win as much as you can. I fall into the former category and it's been a good time.

When you make a new player, you pick your height, size, weight, and position (all of which affect your stat distribution) and from there, you pick a team and start playing matches....maybe. Started with a prestigious English Premier League team ? Well, you're not good enough yet, so they'll either loan you out to a team that can use you right away, or just straight up put you up for sale.

Once you start getting regular matches, you start getting experience points. Once you level up, you get to explore _FIFA 22_'s new Player Development interface. Essentially, it's a talent tree akin to old _World of Warcraft_. When you level up, you get points that you can put in (ir)relevant categories. Striker? You probably want to put points into the Shooting and Pace trees. Midfielder? Passing and dribbling. And so on. It's a solid first-draft that I like way more than the old system of "pass X times to improve passing" as certain situations could be hard to create. I really like it but see room for improvement so I hope it gets some more refinements in _EA Football FC 2023_

On a technical level, _FIFA_ will never be where I want it. The game's menus are slow-to-respond, animations look wooden, minor bugs will constantly pepper your experience and at least once every two or three weeks you get a major bug that means you have to restart the game. For these reasons alone, I can't rate it higher than 10 as they negatively impact the overall experince. 

Games can be quick when you set them to four-minute halves meaning a full match from start to finish is roughly 10 minutes. You definitely get that popcorn/junkfood "just one more game."

I am a Soccer nerd. I've read most of _Inverting the Pyramid_ by Jonathon Wilson and listen to _Football Weekly_ and _Totally Football_ every week because I am sucker for "Sports Narratives." That's how I'm able to enjoy _FIFA 22_ so much. When I get into a bad form, I start to feel pressure to improve. When the Champions's League draw comes out, I look at my group and start wondering about how if I can quality for the knockout stage. And while it's not a 38 week journey, spending a week to win the league title but needed outside results go your way contributes to a nail-biting experince.  

Heck, sometimes I just like to day dream about _Football Weekly's_ Barry Glendenning waxing about my player character and wondering why he keeps having to pose the rhetorical question "is he actually a good player?" to an eager Max Rushden. There's something very special about taking my beloved Shimizu S-Pulse to a treble-winning season.
