# _Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers_ Presents: My 2021 In Games
![FFVII_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5658865/71638913-f7696580-2caf-11ea-986e-968cf17807dd.jpg)
\-\-SLUG-Goes-HERE\-\-

Let me start off by saying, I made a rule for myself: _Final Fantasy XIV_ would win every year if I didn't adjust my criteria. So instead, I'm havirg the land of Eorzea sponsor this year's gaming roundup. Granted, I'm writing this in November and _Endwalker_ comes out the beginning of December. So I may just have to shuffle things around. 

Where do I start? 2021 was an incredibly difficult year me. There were some materialistic highs (getting a PS5, Xbox Series X, and OLED switch all in the same year) but also some deep personal lows (which are out of scope for here). Looking back, I am still processing everything and I wonder how I will view 2021 as time moves on.

Much like in [2019](https://www.nowitsawkward.com/social/2020/01/01/my-2019-games.html), I've opted to chronicle my 2021 through the video games I've played. Looking at my catalog, I played 19 games, beating most of the ones that can be beaten. I'll share my top 10 + a few honorable mentions because, well, I felt they were noteworthy and they earned the honors I've deigned upon them! 



# Honorable Mention
I actually did not "collect" many games this year. What I mean is I purchased very few games and those that I did, I played through immediately afterwards! These games are unranked but can essentially all be considered tied for 11.


## Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (2020)
### Most Disappointing, Longest Load Times
![HYRULE]()

I don't play many 無双 (muso) games and was hopeful that _Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity_ would do enough to keep me engaged with its gameplay while exploring a timeline I was deeply interested in. The game is a prequel to  _Breath of the Wild_ taking place during the war against the Calamity Ganon -- the result of which is the backdrop for _BotW_. I was so ready to see _how_ we failed and in late January of 2021, I finished completing the last few side missions and unlocked all the characters. 

I put roughly 40 hours into the game and felt that, while I definitely got my money's worth in terms of playtime, it was not the satisfying prequel I was hoping it would be. While I appreciated the varying gameplay mechanics of the different characters, load times and plot (no spoilers here) soured my experience. Ultimately, it wasn't what I wanted outed of _Hyrule Warriors_. I felt the gameplay was fine so maybe I'll take a look at the next _Fire Emblems_ 無双 game -- at least from a safe distance. 

## Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition (2020)
### Most Irreverant, Most Confusing
My first Playstation 5 experience (I hadn't played _Astro's Playroom_ yet) came in the form of Capcom's _Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition_. This was my first DMC experience and while gameplay was fun, I found myself constantly trying to keep up with a plot that made very little sense to me despite watching a "Story So Far" video included in the main menu. 

The game looks amazing and is technically one of the best games I've seen. On the PS5, the game has fantastic load times and high framerate (in performance mode) which really emphasizes how powerful the PS5 is and helps match the fast pace of the game. 

The absurd presentation and self-irreverance gives _Devil May Cry 5_  a fun, refreshing charm that I don't often see in my normal wheelhouse of games. The over-the-top nature actually helped get me into the game early on as each sequence but almost to the game's detriment, I kept wanting to understand more and wasn't able to grasp many answers. I felt if I started with the series back when it was younger, maybe I'd have gotten more out of the game. My experience with it didn't get it into the top 10, however, I definitely feel it was noteworthy.

I will never-not-love reading emo poetry as a special attack. 

## Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade Episode: INTERMission
### Most Testuya Nomura, Most Good Looking-est
2021 saw the release of the Playstation 5 version of _Final Fantasy VII Remake_ named something straight out of _Kingdom Hearts_. The PS5 exclusive DLC, _Episode: INTERMission_ or is that _EPISODE: INTERMission_, I can't quite remember. I put this in my honorable mentions because, while I enjoyed the DLC, it occupied a good weekend and then I didn't touch the game again. I enjoyed myself but when I was getting ready to start a new game to see at all again, I just couldn't motivate myself. That feeling has since stuck with me as I write this.

_Integrade_ looks even better on the PS5 but what really makes me appreciate the update is getting the full game at a very stable 60 frames per second. The game looks amazing, straight up. It's a technical marvel and I still don't think I played a game this year that comes close to the fidelity. 

_Episode: INTERMission_ is a welcome addition to the game and is the right kind of teaser for what's to come in part 2 of the remake. Yuffie's ability to cover both physical and magical damage depending on her stance makes it really satisfying as you switch around. The materia system returns and continues to satisfy the lizard part of my brain that wants numbers to go up. Plot wise, they are starting to lean into more of the expanded _Compendium of Final Fantasy VII_ plot points which is... worrying. 

# 10. FIFA 22 (2021)
![GAME10]()

## Best Sports RPG, Easiest Way to Lose Three Hours
First, let's address this upfront: _FIFA Ultimate Team_ is the one of the worst things to happen in Video Game History. Even if it's not gambling, it's close enough to the spirit of gambling, that I round it up to gambling. I've never opened a single pack and have zero intention to touch that mode every. Still with me? 

I haven't played a soccer game since _FIFA 16_ but this year (probably because of the Euros in the summer) I got the itch. In my opinion, the soon-to-be-renamed _FIFA_ series' career mode may be one of the best RPG experiences ever -- assuming you like the game of Association Football (soccer) and enjoy "Sports Narratives." You can either be a player, limiting yourself to a that player's career (joining a team and playing along AI teammates trying to win trophies). Or, you can be a manager (playing the entire team in the process) and win as much as you can. I fall into the former category and it's been a good time.

There are so many RPG trappings in a Player Career. When you make a new player, you pick your height, size, weight, and position (all of which affect your stat distribution) and from there, you pick a team and start playing matches....maybe. Starting with a prestigious English Premier League team? Well, you're not good enough yet, so they'll either loan you out to a team that can use you right away, or just straight up put you up for sale.

Once you start getting into matches, you start getting experience points. Once you level up, you get to explore _FIFA 22_'s new Player Development system. Essentially, it's a talent tree akin to old _World of Warcraft_. When you level up, you get points that you can put in (ir)relevant categories. Striker? You probably want to put points into the Shooting and Pace trees. Midfielder? Passing and dribbling. And so on. It's a solid first-draft that I like it way more than the old system of "pass X times to improve passing" as certain situations could be hard to create. I really like it and at the same time, I see room for improvement. I hope it gets some more refinements in _EA Football FC 2023_

On a technical level, _FIFA_ will never be where I want it. The game's menus are slow-to-respond, animations look wooden, minor bugs will constantly pepper your experience and at least once every two or three weeks you get a major bug that means you have to restart the game. For these reasons alone, I can't rate it higher than 10 as they negatively impact the overall experince.  Thankfully, games can be as short as 10 minutes making it easy to fall into the "just one more game" hole.

I am a Soccer nerd. I've read most of _Inverting the Pyramid_ by Jonathon Wilson and listen to _Football Weekly_ and _Totally Football_ every week because I am sucker for "Sports Narratives." That's how I'm able to enjoy _FIFA 22_ so much. When I get into a bad form, I start to feel pressure to improve. When the Champions's League draw comes out, I look at my group and start wondering about if I can quality for the knockout stage. And while it's not a 38 week journey, spending a 10 days to win the league title can be a nail biting experience when other results need to go my way. 

Heck, sometimes I just like to day dream about _Football Weekly's_ Barry Glendenning waxing about my player character and wondering why he keeps having to pose the rhetorical question "is he actually a good player?" to an eager Max Rushden. 

There's something very special about taking my beloved Shimizu S-Pulse to a treble-winning season.

# 9. Hitman III (2021)
![GAME9]()
## Best Game to Ironman, Darkest Humor
_Hitman III_ came out in the US in January but actually didn't arrive in Japan until the fall. The game itself concludes the current story arc built in it's two predecessors and one of my favorite things IO Interactive has done is making _Hitman I_ and _Hitman II_ maps playable within the _Hitman III_ engine (as long as you're willing to pay).

The game's a delightful, emergent, environmental puzzle game. Figuring out how to reach your target as stealthily (or loud) as possible gives you the opportunity to have a drastically different approach to your friends. Story Missions in the game offer streamlined approaches that also contextualize and build little on the (light) stories of each location. When you add the self-imposed restriction of not saving your progress mid-mission, you really find yourself exploring and exploiting what rules you know. Figuring out how to work within and bend the game's rules can make for nailbiting and hilarious moments (look up the home-targeting briefcase when you get the chance).

# 8. Pokémon Unite (2021)
![GAME8]()
## Best Surprise, Best Dunks
_Pokémon Unite_, the Pokémon MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena), had _ZERO_ reason to be this good. Announced last year, I had very low expectations but _Unite_ exceeded every single one. It's a MOBA through and through both in the good sense and the bad so if those types of games are not for you, then this probably won't change your mind.

The game is free to play with all the tropes that come with it. _Unite_ is full of various currencies and grindy time sinks. If you find yourself wanting to climb up the ladder in Ranked mode, you'll set yourself up for an even longer, more frustrating grind. But winning is so fun.

My general advice for people when it comes to MOBAs is that you have to enjoy winning just as much as the gameplay itself. That's the only real way you'll end up sticking with and improving with the game. 

I'm really streaky on _Unite_. I find myself not touching it for two weeks and then doing nothing but playing it for three. It's just a plain old good time and with arguably my favorite "scoring" system. This game has the best dunks. 

# 7. Metriod Dread (2021)
![GAME7]()
## Most Fun to go Fast, Best Moment in Gaming
_Metroid Dread_ is only my third Metriod (_Prime_ (GCN), _Samus Returns_ (3DS)) game but it's easily my favorite. Made by MercurySteam, a lot of the DNA from _Samus Returns_ on the 3DS is here in _Dread_ but it's more refined. 

Despite the name, _Dread_ is not that dreadful but it is really atmospheric and skilled at building anxiety. Getting lost can be uneasy or terrorfying depending on whether or not you're being chased by one of the game's pursuing enemies.

_Dread_ is fun to learn. When you start getting familiar with the routes, it becomes incredibly satisfying to go fast and it's one of the few games that I want to start a new game as soon as I beat it.

# 6. Apex: Legends (2019)
![GAME7]()
## Most Fun to go Fast, Best Moment in Gaming
I got into Battle Royale games this year. I remember playing _PLAYER UNKNOWN'S Battlegrounds_ for a hot minute in 2018 but didn't really touch the genre since. When _Apex: Legends_ came out on Nintendo Switch, I gave the team-based Battle Royale game a shot. When I realized how much fun I was having, I installed it on my PS5 and didn't look back. 

I am not big on First-Person Shooter games these days. They were deep in my rotation as a teenager and through college but I just don't have the same fervor for them that I used to. _Apex_ has definitely become my go-to FPS game and will probably continue to be for the foreseeable future. 

Controls are extremely customizable so they're essentially perfect (once you find what works for you). Sprinting, sliding, and jumping all feel great. And if you put in the time to learn your favorite guns, you'll be rewarded when your bullet trails effectively look like a garden hose! 

While matches vary widely, Apex has consistently provided me with lots of small good (and bad) moments. A big part of that has been the battle pass system which I use to explore characters and weapons that I tend to neglect. Sometimes you forget how effective a weapon can be and when the daily challenge can remind you! Whether it was reaching Platinum for the first time or even costing your team the win, my time this year with Apex has been time well spent. 

 I've definitely cooled off as the year went on -- I only have so much patience for hot-drops and leavers. Ranked is essentially a different game that demands patience and coordination to perform well. Finding that middle-ground inbetween is rare for me since I am mostly a solo player. That said, I enjoy my time in Apex and regularly keep an eye on it. 

# 2. Bloodborne (2014)
![GAME2]()
## _Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers_ Presents: My Game of the Year
I am so sorry, _Bloodborne_. You were number on my list literally until December. 

# 1. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker (2021)
![GAME1]()
I just.... they did it. It's very hard to describe how monumental it felt clearing the story of _Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker_ mid-December. The culmination of a literaly ten year storyline (that I have been part of for roughly four years).
