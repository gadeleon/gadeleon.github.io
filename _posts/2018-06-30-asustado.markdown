It's a tad dramatic, I know.

Dates have finally been confirmed and I'm off to Tokyo on July 4th at 06:00! 
With a brief stop in Minneapolis, I arrive in Haneda the next day at 14:00. I 
originally wanted to use an image of the President from Independence Day as he
gives one of the most rousing speeches that has ever graced the silver screen.

In reality though, I'm closer to this:

It's very odd to boil your life down to two oversized suitcases
and a massive 40L travel backpack. It's not a case of "you learn what
matters" but more of a "I know someone who will appreciate this more than I have, 
I hope they can take it!" When they do, everybody wins! It feels <i>off</i>
because there's a lingering sense of forgetting to pack something or if what I 
am bringing is the right thing to bring. It's a source of persistent stress.

Speaking of stress, I was told by my relocation coordinator that relocation
is one of the most stressful things someone can do. It turns out they were
extremely correct. There's a lot of <i>hurry-up-and-wait</i> that goes 
along with relocation whether it's waiting for a visa to process or waiting for
confirmation for travel dates. Thankfully there have been a few helpful 
distractions.

For the past month, I've been on the junket meeting as many people as I can and 
visiting places in New York City that have been on my list. It's been 
endearing seeing people send well-wishes, offering advice, or even just 
taking a moment to say they'll miss me. It was hilarious going to 
<i>Next Level</i> on a Wednesday, compete in a fighting game, and lose my only
two matches convincingly. I am even starting to appreciate speaking in English;
it won't be long before I'll have to speak it slowly (after failing to speak
Japanese slowly!)

Eventually, I settled on <i>Star Wars</i> for this post's image (largely because 
I love <i>Star Wars</i>). For Luke, he would often look to the horizan dreaming
of being something more than a simple farmboy. As I get closer to my travel date,
I've breaking rules of New Yorkers (like looking up) to take in as much as I can
of the last ten years of my life. 

The next time you hear from me, it'll probably be in a different time zone!
