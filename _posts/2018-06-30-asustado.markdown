It's a tad dramatic, I know.

Dates have finally been confirmed and I'm off to Tokyo on July 4th at 06:00! 
With a brief stop in Minneapolis, I arrive in Haneda the next day at 14:00. I 
origanlly wanted to use an image of the President from Independence Day as he
gives one of the most rousing speeches that has ever graced the silver screen.

It's very odd to think about boiling your life down to two oversized masses of 
luggage and a massive 40L travel backpack. It's not a case of "you learn what
matters" but more of a case of "you learn what you're willing to lug around the
world."
