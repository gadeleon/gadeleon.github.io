Yup...

A belated sorry for folks who are worried about my wellbeing. The news from
Kansai and Western Japan has been sad to see on the news and I'm sorry for not
letting people know I'm okay here in Tokyo as soon as I should have.

It's been one full week since I landed in Tokyo and I've learned several things:
* I can sweat a lot when it's 85+ degrees and 92% humidity
* <i>Nude Trump</i> is sadly just a clothing store.
* New York City rush hour is good practice for Tokyo rush hour. 

Tokyo is hot. Unmercifully, brutally, hot. But it's the humidity. The humidity 
compels you to collapse against the closest wall and melt in a puddle of your
own sweat. After walking for ten minutes at 8:45AM, you're already coated in
a pronounced sheen of sweat. Pretty much every shirt I've worn to work has had 
two shades of color: normal and damp. The damp comes in several designs based on 
however I  wear my backpack outside. I've been trying to mix it up and see what
looks better where. 

I don't really have much to say about <i>Nude Trump</i>. I'm not sure if I'm
relieved or disappointed that it's some trendy clothing store. The name is
definitely an attention getter so "well done to you, marketing department." 
Here I am talking about your surprisingly-legitimate-or-is-it-really-if-I-know-the-secret-password
business endeavor. It's quite close to my apartment so maybe it's a good thing
that I'm not living next to an extra-curricular recreation center. 

Commutes have been quite interesting. The Greater Tokyo area is 9.3 million
people (around 13 million if you count the entire prefecture). That rivals 
New York city's numbers (roughly 8.5 million in the five boroughs plus another
three million commuting in during the day). If you didn't know any better, you'd
assume Tokyo has three times the population. While carts are bigger, pretty
much every train is like the 4,5,6 during rush hour. The platforms get crowded
incredibly quickly; once the trains open, a wave of people cascade towards the
nearest exits. 

I always felt confident in my ability to navigate crowds while in  New York; 
Tokyo is actually making me concentrate. Since cars drive on the left side of 
the road in Japan, people are inclined to walk on the left side. Most of the time.
My brain is having a hard time deprogramming "walk on the right side" and it's 
not helped by the fact that both tourists and commuters in Tokyo walk on both 
sides of the sidewalk. Thankfully the train stations fixed this problem
by putting up signage indicating which side to walk on during rush hour.

There's a lot more I can talk about but I'll hold back for now. A national 
holiday is coming up Monday (Ocean Day). I'm hoping to walk around and find 
interesting festivals related to the holiday. Or I may just watch Jurassic World 2.
It's getting released to theaters (Friday the 13th) here in Japan. It's a 
respectable three weeks <b>before</b> <i>The Incredibles 2</i> comes out.

Speaking of Ocean Day. Last week I happened upon a "Save The Ocean" festival.
They had something not-so-great.

You could take a photo with the camel and even pet it if you wanted. Seemingly
harmless at first until you walked to the other side of the booth and realized
the exotic experience was brought to you by...

Camel Cigarettes.
